# Summer Activities

Christian Youth Ministries of Hawaii (CYMOH) has been taking college students/young adults on short term missions trips to the islands of Hawaii to assist local missionaries and churches with their summer outreach programs for the past 50 years.  Founded by retired Liberty University professors, Bob & Brenda Bonheim, CYMOH been instrumental in the leading of hundreds of local youth across the islands to Christ.  CYMOH’s purpose is partnering with existing local ministries to spread the Gospel, encourage and disciple local youth in their walk with Christ, and complete community service work projects.


Typically, we spend a month each summer working at Doris Todd Christian Academy doing service projects and reaching out to the neighborhoods in the area. The first two weeks, we work while paving the way for our overnight camp during the third and into the fourth week. Our emphasis is on reaching the youth and families who attend the school, outreach events, and camp. The final few days on island are spent in rest and relaxation while praising God for the work He has done through the ministry.


Energetic, Christ-loving, healthy young adults are who we look for to go on this trip.  It is  labor intensive and hot. Team members must be good with youth of all ages.  We expect good attitudes and hard work, while at the same time encouraging a closer walk with Christ.


Christian Youth Ministries of Hawaii is currently being led by Corey & Elizabeth Bonheim, Chris and Marla Yeatts, and Dr. Monica Parson and is a missions trip outreach of Thomas Road Baptist Church.
